/**
 * Centralized query keys for TanStack Query
 *
 * This file helps prevent cache key chaos by providing a single source of truth
 * for all query keys used throughout the application.
 *
 * Usage:
 * import { queryKeys } from "@/lib/query-keys";
 *
 * // In your query
 * queryKey: queryKeys.user.all
 *
 * // In your mutation invalidation
 * invalidateQueries: [queryKeys.user.all]
